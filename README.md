It's time to do some math!

What's your favorite math riddle?

Tell me below:

Mine is:

"In reply to an inquiry about the animals on his farm, the farmer says: “I only
ever keep sheep, goats, and horses. In fact, at the moment they are all sheep
bar three, all goats bar four, and all horses bar five.” How many does he have
of each animal?"

The farmer has 3 sheep, 2 goats, and 1 horse. You can solve this easy math riddle with a quick hypothetical. Take sheep: we know that there are three animals that are goats and horses, so we suppose there are two goats and one horse.
